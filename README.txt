The creation of VAPP, or virtual assistant for pair programming, was created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for graduation from the Honors College at the College of Charleston.

The virtual assistant requires use of the Rasa Open Source framework. To train and run the bot, a bash script file is included within this repository.
